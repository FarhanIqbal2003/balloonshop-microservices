# 🧭 Modernization Journey Overview – BalloonShop Microservices

This document provides a **high-level view** of the BalloonShop modernization journey — transitioning from a legacy ASP.NET Web Forms e-commerce application into a modular, .NET 8-based microservices architecture.

The project follows the **Strangler Fig pattern**, ensuring the legacy system remains fully operational while new microservices gradually replace its internal logic.

## 🗂️ Migration Roadmap

| Phase | Title | Version Tag | Description | Linked Doc |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 🪞 0 | **Baseline Setup** | `v0.1-baseline` | Imported the legacy BalloonShop Web Forms application, established Git repository, and added core documentation. | [phase-0-baseline-setup.md](migration/phase-0-baseline-setup.md) |
| 🧩 1 | **Structure Setup** | `v0.2-structure-setup` | Created clean folder structure for legacy, services, shared, database, and documentation. No code refactoring performed. | [phase-1-structure-setup.md](migration/phase-1-structure-setup.md) |
| 🌿 2 | **API Façade (Catalog Service)** | `v0.3-api-facade` | Developed the first .NET 8 microservice (`CatalogService`) that exposes read-only catalog endpoints using the legacy database. | [phase-2-api-facade.md](migration/phase-2-api-facade.md) |
| 🧱 3 | **Legacy Modernized Clone (Strangler Integration)** | `v0.4-modernized-clone` | Created a safe clone of the legacy app (`/legacy-modernized/`) to demonstrate the Strangler Fig pattern — legacy pages now call APIs instead of DB logic. | [legacy-modernized/README.md](../legacy-modernized/balloonshop/README.md) |
| 🔗 4 | **Service Expansion & Shared Components** | `v0.5-services-expansion` | Added new microservices (Orders, Users, Cart, Payments) and introduced `/shared` library for DTOs and cross-service contracts. | migration/phase-4-services-expansion.md |
| 🧮 5 | **Database Refactor & Migrations** | `v0.6-database-refactor` | Introduced per-service databases, migration scripts, and data synchronization logic. Legacy database begins phased deprecation. | migration/phase-5-database-refactor.md |
| 🚀 6 | **Full Transition to Microservices** | `v1.0-release` | Legacy app fully replaced by microservices. Optionally introduce new frontend (Blazor/MVC/React). | migration/phase-6-final-transition.md |

## 🎯 Guiding Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Strangler Fig Pattern** | The new system gradually replaces the old by routing traffic to new APIs one feature at a time. |
| **Zero Downtime Modernization** | The legacy site remains functional throughout the transition. |
| **Incremental Value Delivery** | Each phase delivers measurable, demonstrable improvements. |
| **Documentation First** | Every milestone is version-tagged and documented for clarity and learning value. |
| **Backward Compatibility** | Shared models and APIs maintain consistent behavior until fully migrated. |

## 🧭 Notes for Reviewers / Recruiters

This repository is designed not just as a code migration but as a **case study in incremental modernization**.  
Each commit and phase tag reflects architectural decision-making, risk management, and practical implementation of real-world modernization patterns.

For detailed rationale behind the chosen approach, refer to:
- `docs/migration/phase-0-baseline-setup.md` → Initial conditions and legacy import  
- `docs/migration/phase-1-structure-setup.md` → Foundation for microservice growth  
- `docs/migration/phase-2-api-facade.md` → Start of the Strangler Fig integration  

---

**Current status:** ✅ *Phase 1 completed – Structure Setup*  
**Next step:** 🌿 *Begin Phase 2: API Façade (Catalog Service)*
