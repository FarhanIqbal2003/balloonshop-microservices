# 🎈 BalloonShop Modernization Journey  
### From ASP.NET Web Forms → .NET 8 Microservices (Strangler Fig Pattern)

---

## 🧭 Overview

This repository documents the complete modernization journey of the **BalloonShop e-commerce** application — originally built with **ASP.NET Web Forms and SQL Server** — into a modern, cloud-ready **.NET 8 microservices architecture**.

The project follows the **Strangler Fig pattern**, ensuring that the legacy system remains fully functional while new microservices are introduced gradually.  
Each modernization phase is version-tagged, documented, and designed to demonstrate safe, incremental evolution.

## 🧩 Modernization Phases

| Phase | Title | Description | Deliverable |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **0. Baseline Setup** | Import and document the original legacy BalloonShop application. | Working ASP.NET Web Forms site and initial repo documentation. |
| **1. Structure Setup** | Create repository structure for legacy, services, shared, and docs folders. Preserve baseline; no code refactoring yet. | Organized project layout and phase documentation (`v0.2-structure-setup`). |
| **2. API Façade (Catalog Service)** | Introduce .NET 8 Catalog Service exposing product and category endpoints from the legacy DB. Connect it to the `legacy-modernized` clone for Strangler integration. | First .NET 8 API operational and accessible (`v0.3-api-facade`). |
| **3. Legacy Modernized Clone** | Integrate the cloned Web Forms site with new APIs. Demonstrate the Strangler Fig pattern without touching original legacy code. | Legacy clone successfully consuming CatalogService (`v0.4-modernized-clone`). |
| **4. Service Expansion** | Add additional microservices (Orders, Users, Cart, Payments). Share DTOs and contracts through `/shared/`. | Multi-service environment functional (`v0.5-services-expansion`). |
| **5. Database Refactor & Migrations** | Transition from shared DB to per-service databases using EF Core migrations. | Split databases and schema alignment (`v0.6-database-refactor`). |
| **6. Identity & Auth Modernization** | Introduce centralized identity service (JWT-based). Replace legacy membership provider. | Secure, tokenized authentication (`v0.7-identity-service`). |
| **7. Frontend Modernization** | Optionally replace Web Forms UI with Blazor or MVC frontend consuming APIs. | Fully decoupled frontend (`v0.8-frontend`). |
| **8. Legacy Sunset** | Retire the original Web Forms app once all functionality has been modernized. | Complete transition to microservices (`v1.0-release`). |

## 🪴 Architectural Approach

**Pattern:** Strangler Fig  
**Principle:** “Let the new system grow around the old, one feature at a time.”

- 🧱 The legacy site stays fully functional.  
- 🌿 New .NET 8 APIs (Catalog, Orders, etc.) replace internal logic incrementally.  
- 🔁 Shared DTOs ensure data consistency between legacy and new APIs.  
- 🚀 Gradual replacement avoids downtime and enables continuous progress.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Area | Technology |
|------|-------------|
| **Legacy** | ASP.NET 4.x, Web Forms, ADO.NET, SQL Server |
| **New Services** | .NET 8 Web API, EF Core, REST, Docker |
| **Communication** | HTTP (initial), RabbitMQ (later) |
| **Gateway** | YARP / Ocelot |
| **Frontend** | React (TypeScript) or Blazor |
| **Auth** | ASP.NET Core Identity + JWT |
| **Data** | Separate SQL Server databases (per service) |
| **Infra / CI** | Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, GHCR |
| **Observability** | Serilog, OpenTelemetry (tracing, metrics) |

---

## ⚙️ Local Development

1. **Phase 0:** Run `/legacy/balloonshop` using Visual Studio (ASP.NET Framework).  
2. **Phase 1+:** Use Docker Compose to bring up hybrid environment:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   This will eventually run the new .NET services, gateway, database, and message broker.

---

## 🚀 Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) will:
1. Build legacy solution (.NET Framework).  
2. Build and test .NET 8 microservices.  
3. Build Docker images and push to GitHub Container Registry.  
4. Optionally deploy hybrid stack to staging.
